## Installation

* Get the [RFduino hardware](http://RFduino.com).

* Download [Arduino 1.5](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases) (The latest version, 1.6.3, is not compatible at this time).
  * _If you're on OSX_: Remember to open Arduino _first_ to make gatekeeper perform its magic!

* Copy the Arduino library into the appropriate directory for your system. (Folder should be named ```RFduino```, not ```RFduino-master```):

# Communicating with us

The best way to communiate with us is on the [RFduino Forum](http://forum.RFduino.com).

### A Lot More Coming!

We are working on documentation as fast as we can.  Until then, the best source for documentation is the sketch examples.

This project has been a huge success, and we have many exciting things planned that we want to share with the community.  At the same time, we are unbelievable busy, with a ton going on and lots of small items to clean up.  We are just a small team working on this project ... please bear with us!

We hope you enjoy creating stuff with your RFduino as much as we do!

The RFduino team.
