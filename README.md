* Download Arduino 1.5 here: [http://arduino.cc](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)  
  (on osx remember to open arduino first to make gatekeeper perform its magic)  

* Create a new directory inside the Sketch directory called "hardware", inside this new directory create another directory called "RFduino"
  Copy the RFduino directory from this repository into that directory
  (on Windows, "My Documents\Arduino\hardware\RFduino")  
  (on OSX, "Documents/Arduino/hardware/RFduino")  
  or "git clone https://github.com/RFduino/RFduino" in the directory indicated

### Communicating with us

The best way to communiate with us is here: [RFduino Forum](http://forum.RFduino.com).

### A Lot More Coming!

We are working on documentation as fast as we can.  Until then, the best source for documentation is the sketch examples.

This project has been a huge success, and we have many exciting things planned that we want to share with the community.  At the same time, we are unbelievable busy, with a ton going on and lots of small items to clean up.  We are just a small team working on this project ... please bear with us!

We hope you enjoy creating stuff with your RFduino as much as we do!

The RFduino team.
