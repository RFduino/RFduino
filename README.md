### Communicating with us

The best way to communiate with us is here: [RFduino Forum](http://forum.RFduino.com).

### A Lot More Coming!

We are working on documentation as fast as we can.  Until then, the best source for documentation is the sketch examples.

This project has been a huge success, and we have many exciting things planned that we want to share with the community.  At the same time, we are unbelievable busy, with a ton going on and lots of small items to clean up.  We are just a small team working on this project ... please bear with us!

We hope you enjoy creating stuff with your RFduino as much as we do!

The RFduino team.
