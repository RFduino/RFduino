## Communicating with us

The best way to communiate with us is on the [RFduino Forum](https://web.archive.org/web/2017/http://forum.RFduino.com) (obsolete) or [Arduino Forum](https://forum.arduino.cc).

## Installation

* Get the [RFduino hardware](https://web.archive.org/web/2017/http://www.rfduino.com/) (obsolete).

* Install the [FTDI drivers](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm).

* Download [Arduino 1.6.6](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or newer.
  * _Mac OS X_: Requires Java 6 to be installed. Available [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US).
  * Note: The default Package in Ubuntu 16.04 is to old 1.5.3 and does not support adding hardware support.

* Open Arduino
  * Edit Preferences, and add ```https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Alkarex/6b9a7f2e311805b6e238419e145b6c67/raw/0fa858b8c60b9cdddcce2d5c501eca3f866ed62b/package_rfduino166_index.json``` to Additional Board Manager URLs and save.
      ![preferences](preferences.png)
  * Open the Boards Manager under ```Tools->Board``` menu.
  * Select the RFduino package at the end of the list, and click Install to install it.
  * Your new board will now show up in the ```Tools->Board``` menu.

Select the board and port, and you're ready to go!

<strong>Note</strong>: Arduino may not start properly if another version has been previously installed and the Preferences are incompatible.  You can reset the Preferences by deleting the following directory:
* _Windows_: %appdata%/Arduino15 (open File Explorer, enter %appdata% into the Address Bar and press Enter)
* _Mac OS X_: ~/Library/Arduino15 (open Finder, and ```Go->Go to Folder```)
* _Linux_: ~/.arduino15

## Linux

```
// FTDI drivers are not needed (they are built into the kernel)

wget http://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.6.6-linux64.tar.xz
tar -xf arduino-1.6.6-linux64.tar.xz

Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install default-jre
Fedora: sudo yum install jre
OpenSUSE: sudo zypper install jre

// otherwise the com port open will fail with permission denied (you must logout/login for change to take effect)
sudo usermod -aG dialout <username>
```

## Getting Started

* Attach the USB shield

* Select RFduino from the ```Tools->Board``` menu

* Select the port from the ```Tools->Port``` menu

* Select an example from the ```File->Examples->RFduinoNonBLE``` or ```File->Examples-?RFduinoBLE``` directory

* Select ```Upload``` to compile, upload and execute the sketch

* Download the iPhone example apps from the iPhone App Store (search for ```RFduino```).
    * Detailed instructions for the Temperature app are available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://files.rfdigital.com/rfduino.temperature.guide.pdf).
    * Detailed instructions for the ColorWheel app are available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://files.rfdigital.com/rfduino.rgb.colorwheel.guide.pdf).
